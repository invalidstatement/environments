AI | Todd.Puffer: How about your screen "blacking out" round the edges when you run out of air
CmdrMatthew: I just need to stop the noclipping
CmdrMatthew: maybe
AI | Todd.Puffer: And when it goes utterly black,you die
CmdrMatthew: idk how I would do that
AI | Todd.Puffer: And when energy runs out the HUD sparkles and turns off?
AI | Todd.Puffer: As without energy,it wont run
CmdrMatthew: yeah, maybe
