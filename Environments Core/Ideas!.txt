AI | Todd.Puffer: How about your screen "blacking out" round the edges when you run out of air
CmdrMatthew: I just need to stop the noclipping
CmdrMatthew: maybe
AI | Todd.Puffer: And when it goes utterly black,you die
CmdrMatthew: idk how I would do that
AI | Todd.Puffer: And when energy runs out the HUD sparkles and turns off?
AI | Todd.Puffer: As without energy,it wont run
CmdrMatthew: yeah, maybe

11:02 PM - BlackMac: A factory
11:02 PM - CmdrMatthew: that does what?
11:04 PM - BlackMac: Make a goal first, maybe mining or something like that that equals to 
collecting resoruces that you can't just spawn. 
That saves to your character, then you spawn a factory (which is free), 
with enough resoruces you can fabricate a machine or something that 
normaly you can't spawn from the menu, it saves in a special invenotry. 
Maybe good weapons, or good life support things etc. and you can't 
duplicate that. So people have a goal while they play
